## Who Are We?
Grassroots Grocery is a nonprofit powered by a network of neighbors helping neighbors. Fighting for dignified food access for all, we activate communities by getting fresh food to those who need it most.
## Tech @ Grassroots Grocery
We're powered by really cool tech that is 100% volunteer-created! We use low-code and no-code platforms, as well as traditional coding. This is our home on GitHub for our code, which we host publicly and encourage open source contributions to.
